- A subtype is not a subtype in a reflective environment

    is_gtk(o) = o.getClass.getName.contains("gtk")
  
  => subclassing foo_gtk in foo_ggttkk makes objects of type foo_ggttkk
  answers "false" to is_gtk.

- A subtype is not a subtype in a multi-user environment

  When given a Polygon, some code may assume the number of edges won't change.

    print_polygon(poly, do_something) =
       nb = poly.nb_edges
       do_something()
       (1..nb).each{|i| poly.get_edge(i).print}
    print_polygon(poly, (() -> poly.add_edge))
 
  The do_something has changed the Polygon, breaking the assumption that a
  Polygon is constant and won't change.
