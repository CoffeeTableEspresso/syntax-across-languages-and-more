I'll answer your second question first, and then I'll try to
explain the differences between approaches of MetaOCaml and Dynamic Caml.

It is true that MetaOcaml supports multi-stage generation on a syntactic
level:
   let f x = .< fun y -> .< fun z -> x + y + z >. >.
   let i = (.! (.! f 1) 2) 3 (* 6 *)
Dynamic Caml currently does not have this kind of syntax, i.e.
it does not support {< ... >} inside {< ... >}.
But that does not mean that you cannot do multistage generation
with Dynamic Caml.
As often, if some consruct is not supported in Dynamic Caml, you
can simulate it by functional wrappers.
If dml supported embedded {< >}, the above code would look like:
   let f x = {< fun y -> {< fun z -> ``x + `y + z >} >}
   let i = (eval ((eval (f 1) 2) 3
(note the number of backquotes before x and y).
One can manually translate this into dynamically generated applications of
Rtcg primitives - replacing "{< fun z -> ... >}" with
(apply (quote abstr) (abstr (fun z -> ...))), "`y" with
"(apply (quote quote) y)" etc,  resulting in the following:
   let plus o1 o2 = int_bin o1 IOpADD o2
   let f x =
     abstr (fun y ->
       apply (quote abstr)
	   (abstr (fun z ->
                        (apply
			(apply (quote plus)
			   (apply
			      (apply (quote plus)
					(quote (quote x)) (*1*)
  	 	      )
			      (apply (quote quote) y)
			   )
			)
			z
		     )
		  )
	   )
	)
   let i = (eval ((eval (f 1) 2) 3
(* 1: direct translation of ``x will be (apply (quote quote) (quote x)),
    but this can be obviously optimized
  *)
This works, though this looks ugly of course :) (so
you probably wont be able to do any serious multi-staging this way).

As you see, it is not impossible to add multi-staging to dml.
The main reason why I have not done this yet is probably lack of
motivation - not many real-life problems seriously benefit from
more than 2 stages of computation. Even in benchmarks provided
with MetaOCaml there are no programs with more than two stages.

You may find further information on how to go from two-stage to
multi-stage generation (for Scheme) in Robert Gluck and Jesper
Jorgensen's paper "Efficient Multi-level Generating Extensions for
Program Specialization" (they study multi-level partial evaluators,
that is DCG with "implicit", or "BTA-style", annotations, but their
implementation includes a multi-level DCG framework).

MetaOCaml is more of the research tool for multi-stage computations,
while my motivation for Dynamic Caml was to build something moreless
usable in real life. I believe that multi-stage features are nice
to have in the language, but they are not (at current stage of
research?) useful enough to dedicate a whole language (or even
non-trivial compiler modifications) for :).

I think also that tools like CamlP4 is indispensable for making this
kind of external libraries - nicely integrated into language and still
keeping the core language and technologies :) behind it intact.

Now, to real stuff :).

You are right in saying that the main difference between MetaOCaml and
Dynamic Caml is the former being a new language while the latter is an
external library. All other differences stem from this principal
difference.

1. Types.
Main research efforts in types as related to DCG concentrate in
avoiding the thing called "arguquoting" in dml manual, that is the
code variable escaping its evaluation scope.
There are two flavours of arguquoting:
* "external arguquoting" can be demonstrated by the following:
     let f = eval {< fun x -> `x >} in
     let g = eval (abstr (fun y -> f 27)) in ...
   Here x escapes its evaluation scope in f.
* "internal arguquoting" happens when code variable is evaluated
   before it's value is known:
     let f = eval {< fun x -> @(eval {< x >}) >} in ...
   Although x is defined in "eval {< x >}", evaluation of "eval {< x >}"
   happens before construction of the function, and thus value of x
   is undefined (not known yet).
MetaOCaml fights "external arguquoting" with a technique called
Cross-Stage Persistence (CSP). That is, MetaOCaml does not give
the user access to "quote" primitive (or "`" operator) - it infers
necessary "quoting level" from type of variable (that is, the level
of .< >. surronding its declaration) and insert the neccessary amount
of quotes.
However, MetaOCaml is unable to detect "internal arguquoting"
statically.

Basically, all research around MetaML was, I believe, concentrated
on finding the type system that prevents these two kinds of arguquoting
without prohibiting "legal" programs. The core of the problem is that
the term given to "eval" should not be contain any free variables
from stages higher or equal to that at which eval is executed.
In the latest papers on the subject (Walid Taha et al. "An Idealized
MetaML: Simpler, and More Expressive") this seems to be achived,
but at the cost of quite verbose syntax. However, it is still unclear
AFAIK whether all legal programs are valid. Walid Taha's excellent
papers on the subject are very interesting (they are available from
his web page).

Dynamic Caml, being just a library, cannot modify the type system,
and hence cannot employ CSP, so it has to provide an explicit "quote"
operator. The above examples of arguquoting will type check in
Dynamic Caml, but their execution will result in exception
UndefinedVariable.

The first example is impossible in MetaOCaml, but the second is:
     let f = .< fun x -> .~(.! .< x >.) >.
MetaOCaml _fully type-checks_ the dynamically generated code at
run-time, and the above will result in TypeCheckingException.

So, MetaOCaml is probably more "sound" than Dynamic Caml,
but this comes at a price of compiler and run-time system
modification.

2. Implementation
First thing to say is that Dynamic Caml is faster than MetaOCaml.
I implemented the benchmarks that come with MetaOCaml in
Dynamic Caml, and code generation times of the latter are 3 to 8
times less than of the former, and the execution time of generated code
(i.e. generated code quality)is the same.

I believe this is due to the facts that Dynamic Caml does not do the
type checking at code generation time (while still detecting
all the problems :)) and that Dynamic Caml uses a specially
designed lightweight code generator and lower level
internal program representation (MetaOCaml reuses ocamlc
code generator which probably was not written with speed
very much in mind :). In fact, the only code generation
cost layer that has been removed in MetaOCaml is parsing.
Type-checking, type inference etc. is there.)

But, of course, not knowing type information at code generation
time in Dynamic Caml leads to quite some problems. There are
may constructs that are not supported natively.
For example, getting a field of a record is tricky because
at run-time there is no way to obtain an offset of a field.
Dynamic Caml here inlines a functional wrapper (in fact,
it get the information about the offset from the bytecode
of a wrapper!).
So it could probably benefit from a little help from his friend,
ocaml compiler :).

Hope this helps, and feel free to criticise this and ask
if something's unclear.
