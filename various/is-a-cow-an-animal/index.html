<h1>Goals</h1>

<ul>
<li>The basic idea comes from <a href="http://www.visviva.com/transframe/papers/covar.htm">Is a Cow an Animal?</a>
<li>The "OCaml with parametric class" implementation comes from <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~remy/work/virtual/virtual005.html">this</a>
</ul>

From these examples, I've been trying to extract a real problem which "Is a
Cow an Animal?" is trying to solve.

<dl>
<dt><a name="goal1">Goal #1</a><dd>
implement the rules below, rejecting at runtime *any* malformed program. 

<p>As seen below, it's pretty easy.

<p>
<dt><a name="goal2">Goal #2</a><dd>
try to enforce the rules at <b>compile-time</b>,

<p>this can be
<ul>
<li>quite easy (eg: ensuring one doesn't feed carrots with grass),
<li>quite hard (eg: ensuring one doesn't feed cows with carrots or dead_rabbits),
<li>or very hard (eg: ensuring meat can be eaten only once)
</ul>

</dl>

<h1>Description of the World</h1>

<ul>
<li>everything has some amount of <i>energy</i>
<li>there are <i>animal</i>s: <i>cow</i>, <i>rabbit</i>, <i>human</i>
<li>there is <i>food</i>:
  <ul><li><i>vegetable</i>: <i>grass</i>, <i>carrot</i>
      <li><i>meat</i>: <i>beef</i>, <i>dead_rabbit</i>, <i>dead_human</i>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>general rules:
<ul>
<li>animals can <i>eat</i> some food, their energy is raised by the food's energy amount
<li>animals can be <i>slaughter</i>ed, the result is meat ; the energy of the meat is
the same as the energy of the animal
<li>there should be a way to handle a list of animals and the energy of each animal
<p>
<li>slaughtered animals can't eat anymore nor be slaughtered again
<li>meat can be eaten only once
<li>whereas vegetable is innumerable and can be eaten more than once
</ul>

<p>animals' accepted food:
<ul>
<li>a cow only eats grass
<li>a rabbit only eats carrots
<li>a human eats carrots and *any* meat
</ul>
IMPORTANT: feeding a cow with something else than grass is a fatal error
(same for feeding a human with grass...)

<p>when slaughtered: 
<ul>
<li>a cow becomes beef
<li>a rabbit becomes dead_rabbit
<li>a human becomes dead_human
</ul>

<h1>Test example</h1>

(using Python's syntax, see the various <a href="#implementations">implementations</a> for some other syntaxes)

<pre>

grass    = new_grass(5)
carrot   = new_carrot(10)

a_rabbit      = new_rabbit(100)
a_cow         = new_cow(1000)
a_human       = new_human(300)
another_human = new_human(350)

for o in [ a_rabbit, a_cow, a_human ]:
    print "%s -> %d" % (o.name, o.energy)

a_rabbit.eat(carrot)
a_cow.eat(grass)

a_dead_rabbit = a_rabbit.slaughter()
a_beef = a_cow.slaughter()

a_human.eat(carrot)
a_human.eat(carrot)
a_human.eat(a_beef)
a_human.eat(a_dead_rabbit)

a_human.eat(another_human.slaughter())

if a_human.energy != 1785: raise "failed"
</pre>

and here are some examples that should fail

<pre>
new_cow(10).slaughter().eat(grass) # meat (food) can't eat
new_cow(10).slaughter().slaughter() # meat (food) can't be slaughtered
carrot.eat(grass)      # vegetable (food) can't eat
carrot.slaughter()     # vegetable (food) can't be slaughtered

new_cow(10).eat(carrot) # cow do not eat carrot
new_cow(10).eat(new_cow(10).slaughter()) # cow do not eat beef
a_human.eat(new_cow(10)) # can't eat live animals
a_human.eat(grass)     # human do not eat grass
a_human.eat(a_beef)    # a_beef is already eaten
a_cow.eat(grass)       # a_cow is dead, it can't eat
a_cow.slaughter()      # a_cow is dead, it can't be slaughtered again
</pre>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
<ul>
<li>the implementation should allow to add new meats which must be accepted by human
</ul>
